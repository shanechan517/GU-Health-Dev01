Another case has caused your case to be blocked. This could be because they could not complete their case or because a case that it was dependent on was not completely correctly and they have insufficient data etc...

Please log into Salesforce and ensure your team does not begin this case until further notice. The account manager will begin the process again once the incident has been resolved.
